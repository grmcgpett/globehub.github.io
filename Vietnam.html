    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
    Nestled along the eastern edge of the Indochinese Peninsula, <strong>Vietnam</strong> is a country of striking contrasts and timeless charm.
    Shaped like an elegant “S,” it stretches over 1,600 kilometers from the misty mountains of the north to the lush Mekong Delta in the south.
    With a population of over 100 million, Vietnam is one of Southeast Asia’s most dynamic and culturally rich nations.
  </p>

  <p>
    Its capital, <strong>Hanoi</strong>, blends centuries-old architecture with a youthful energy, while
    <strong>Ho Chi Minh City</strong> (formerly Saigon) pulses with modern ambition and historical depth.
    Vietnam’s landscapes are as diverse as its people — from the emerald rice terraces of Sapa and the surreal limestone pillars of Ha Long Bay
    to the golden beaches of Da Nang and the vibrant floating markets of the Mekong.
  </p>

  <p>
    Steeped in a history shaped by dynasties, colonialism, and resilience, Vietnam has emerged as a fast-growing economy
    with a strong sense of identity. Its cuisine, a harmonious fusion of flavors and textures, is celebrated worldwide —
    and its people are known for their warmth, hospitality, and enduring spirit.
  </p>

  <p>
    Whether you're drawn by adventure, culture, cuisine, or natural beauty, Vietnam offers a journey that’s as enriching as it is unforgettable.
